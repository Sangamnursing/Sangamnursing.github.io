  <p>
    Welcome to Sangam Nursing, a website dedicated to providing tutorials and resources for aspiring and practicing nurses. Whether you are looking for tips on how to ace your exams, improve your clinical skills, or advance your career, you will find something useful and relevant here.

My name is Sangam, and I am the founder and editor of this website. I have been a registered nurse for over some years, working in various settings such as hospitals and clinics. I have a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge and experience with others who want to pursue a rewarding and challenging career in nursing.

On this website, you will find tutorials on topics such as anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, nursing process, health assessment, infection control, wound care, and more. You will also find advice on how to prepare for interviews, write resumes and cover letters, network with other professionals, and cope with stress and burnout. My goal is to help you achieve your personal and professional goals in nursing.

I hope you enjoy browsing through the website and find it helpful and informative. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to contact me. I would love to hear from you and learn from your experiences as well.
